### Detect Airpods

Using `PyBluez` it is possible to stalk nearby Bluetooth devices and retrieve a list of their MAC addresses. From a MAC address, it is simple to derive the name of the device

## Requirements
This project was created with Python 3.7.6 and on MacOS Mojave. If your system is similar, you need the following. 
```
$ pip3 install pybluez
$ pip3 install pyobjc
```
Then, download xcode off of the app store.

If your system is different, you may require different dependencies to use PyBluez. See the installation guide here `https://pybluez.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html`.
